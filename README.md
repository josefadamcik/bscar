# bscar - Barely Smart Carm

This is my undergoing hobby toy project of smart toy car driven by Arduino micro controller, which communicates with another Arduino wirelessly.

Although I am professional software developer I have almost no knowledge of C++, so If you want to know how things should be done, please look elsewhere.

Projects are developed in [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) (VSCode version). But it should be easy to build it in Arduino IDE, with some slight tweaking.

## Directories

- `car` contains source for car's controller (Arduino Nano)
- `remote` contains source for remote (Arduino Uno)
- `shared` shared header files

## Licence
